# CoolCanvas

**Live Demo - https://matthewmullin01.github.io/coolcanvas/**

CoolCanvas is a simple React application that makes use of the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API). 

It renders a few draggable images using the Canvas API.

## Getting Started
1. Install Dependencies - `npm run install` or `yarn`
2. Run app in the development mode - `npm start` or `yarn start`. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Folder Structure

I tried to keep it simple for now, with the potential to scale to more folders later.

`src/assets` - any assets

`src/components` - any React components. This could be separated into shared components and non-shared components at a later stage if needed.

`src/utils` - Any shared utility methods, interfaces, classes, hooks, etc
